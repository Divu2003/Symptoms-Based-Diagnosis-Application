# Symptoms-Based-Diagnosis-Application
This project leverages machine learning to predict three different diseases based on the symptoms provided by the user. The goal is to assist doctors by providing a preliminary diagnosis based on the symptoms, potentially speeding up the diagnostic process and aiding in decision-making.

# Project Features:

1. Symptom Input: Users can input a variety of symptoms they are experiencing.
   
2. Disease Prediction: The model predicts the most likely disease out of the three based on the provided symptoms.
   
3. User-Friendly Interface: Deployed using Streamlit for an easy-to-use and interactive interface.
